Appointments are a relation between two users: tutor and client.  However, a tutor can also be a client for another tutor.  Therefore, breaking the user model into separate tutor and client models does not solve the problem. 

Instead, we have *three* tables:  Tutor, Client, and Appointment.

          +--------+
         /| Tutor  |\
+------+/ +--------+ \+-------------+
| User |              | Appointment |
+------+\ +--------+ /+-------------+
         \| Client |/
          +--------+

This isn't perfect, rather than 'User has a Tutor / Client', I'd much prefer 'User _is_ a Tutor / Client.'

User
 - has_one :tutor
 - has_one :client

Tutor
 - belongs_to :user
 - has_many :clients, through: :appointment

Client
 - belongs_to :user
 - has_many :tutors, through: :appointment
